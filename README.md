For user story #7, sharing a shopping list, which was tested for in MainActivityTest5, 2 out of the 4 scenarios could not be 
tested for as it dealt with an email app that I had no control over. This is because it was not automated due to the user 
having to log into their email account in order to send the list to a recipent. However, the espresso test can work below if 
the individual who is grading it does not mind logging into their email account and sending to themselves to see that it was
properly delivered. We showed the user story properly working with all scenarios accomplished to Professor Damevski during his 
office hours on October 15th.
