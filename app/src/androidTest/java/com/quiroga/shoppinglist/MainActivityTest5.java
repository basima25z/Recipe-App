// User Story #8: Sharing The Shopping List - As a person who has a family, I want to be able to send my shopping list to someone quickly via email so I can tell them what to buy.
//Scenario #1: Given that a user is looking at a shopping list, when a user presses a “share” button, then the user will be redirected to a messaging app, through which the app will allow the user to select an account to log into.
//Scenario #2: Given that the user is looking at a shopping list, when the user presses a “share” button, then the user will be redirected to a messaging app, that will copy and paste the shopping list to the body of the email.



// The next two scenarios are not shown through espresso testing as it was impossible to do because in order to complete the user story, I had to open a messaging app and the work was done through the app.
// I could not complete the espresso testing because it was not automated due to the user having to log into their email account in order to send the list to a recipent,
// the espresso test can work below if the individual who is grading it does not mind logging into their email account and sending to themselves to see that it was delivered.
// We showed the user story properly working with all scenarios accomplished to Professor Damevski during his office hours on October 15th.

// Scenario #3: Given that the user is looking at a shopping list, when the user presses a “share” button, then the user will be redirected to a messaging app that will have “Shopping List” as the subject of the email.
// Scenario #4: Given that the user has finished typing in the recipient, when the user presses the send button, then the message will be sent to the recipient.
